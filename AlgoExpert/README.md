##Iterative In-order Traversal - VH 1
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and traverses it using the in-order traversal technique but without using recursion. 

As the tree is being traversed, a callback function passed in as an argument to the main function should be called on each node (i.e. callback(currentNode)). 

Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value," a parent node in a property called "parent," and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. 

Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.
